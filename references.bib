  abstract        = {Over the past decade, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become an indispensable tool for transcriptome-wide analysis of differential gene expression and differential splicing of mRNAs. However, as next-generation sequencing technologies have developed, so too has RNA-seq. Now, RNA-seq methods are available for studying many different aspects of RNA biology, including single-cell gene expression, translation (the translatome) and RNA structure (the structurome). Exciting new applications are being explored, such as spatial transcriptomics (spatialomics). Together with new long-read and direct RNA-seq technologies and better computational tools for data analysis, innovations in RNA-seq are contributing to a fuller understanding of RNA biology, from questions such as when and where transcription occurs to the folding and intermolecular interactions that govern RNA function.},

  abstract        = {Through alternative processing of pre-messenger RNAs, individual mammalian genes often produce multiple mRNA and protein isoforms that may have related, distinct or even opposing functions. Here we report an in-depth analysis of 15 diverse human tissue and cell line transcriptomes on the basis of deep sequencing of complementary DNA fragments, yielding a digital inventory of gene and mRNA isoform expression. Analyses in which sequence reads are mapped to exon-exon junctions indicated that 92-94% of human genes undergo alternative splicing, 86% with a minor isoform frequency of 15% or more. Differences in isoform-specific read densities indicated that most alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation events vary between tissues, whereas variation between individuals was approximately twofold to threefold less common. Extreme or 'switch-like' regulation of splicing between tissues was associated with increased sequence conservation in regulatory regions and with generation of full-length open reading frames. Patterns of alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation were strongly correlated across tissues, suggesting coordinated regulation of these processes, and sequence conservation of a subset of known regulatory motifs in both alternative introns and 3' untranslated regions suggested common involvement of specific factors in tissue-level regulation of both splicing and polyadenylation.},

We report reference measurements composed of 41-52 million mapped 25-base-pair reads for poly(A)-selected RNA from adult mouse brain, liver and skeletal muscle tissues. We used RNA standards to quantify transcript prevalence and to test the linear range of transcript detection, which spanned five orders of magnitude. Although >90% of uniquely mapped reads fell within known exons, the remaining data suggest new and revised gene models, including changed or additional promoters, exons and 3' untranscribed regions, as well as new candidate microRNA precursors. RNA splice events, which are not readily measured by standard gene expression microarray or serial analysis of gene expression methods, were detected directly by mapping splice-crossing sequence reads. We observed 1.45 x 10(5) distinct splices, and alternative splices were prominent, with 3,500 different genes expressing one or more alternate internal splices.},

Here, we describe an application of the Illumina sequencing (formerly Solexa sequencing) platform to study mRNA expression levels. Our goals were to estimate technical variance associated with Illumina sequencing in this context and to compare its ability to identify differentially expressed genes with existing array technologies. To do so, we estimated gene expression differences between liver and kidney RNA samples using multiple sequencing replicates, and compared the sequencing data to results obtained from Affymetrix arrays using the same RNA samples. We find that the Illumina sequencing data are highly replicable, with relatively little technical variation, and thus, for many purposes, it may suffice to sequence each mRNA sample only once (i.e., using one lane). The information in a single lane of Illumina sequencing data appears comparable to that in a single array in enabling identification of differentially expressed genes, while allowing for additional analyses such as detection of low-expressed genes, alternative splice variants, and novel transcripts. Based on our observations, we propose an empirical protocol and a statistical framework for the analysis of gene expression using ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology.},

We determined the binding sites and regulatory consequences for several intensely studied RBPs and miRNPs, including PUM2, QKI, IGF2BP1-3, AGO/EIF2C1-4 and TNRC6A-C. Our study revealed that these factors bind thousands of sites containing defined sequence motifs and have distinct preferences for exonic versus intronic or coding versus untranslated transcript regions.

Thus there is a growing need to develop technologies that enable rapid characterization of structural features within complex RNA populations. We have developed a high-throughput technique, SHAPE-Seq, that can simultaneously measure quantitative, single nucleotide-resolution secondary and tertiary structural information for hundreds of RNA molecules of arbitrary sequence. SHAPE-Seq combines selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) chemistry with multiplexed paired-end deep sequencing of primer extension products. This generates millions of sequencing reads, which are then analyzed using a fully automated data analysis pipeline, based on a rigorous maximum likelihood model of the SHAPE-Seq experiment. We demonstrate the ability of SHAPE-Seq to accurately infer secondary and tertiary structural information, detect subtle conformational changes due to single nucleotide point mutations, and simultaneously measure the structures of a complex pool of different RNA molecules. SHAPE-Seq thus represents a powerful step toward making the study of RNA secondary and tertiary structures high throughput and accessible to a wide array of scientific pursuits, from fundamental biological investigations to engineering RNA for synthetic biological systems.},

Although biochemical studies indicate that N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most prevalent internal modification in messenger RNA, an in-depth study of its distribution and functions has been impeded by a lack of robust analytical methods. Here we present the human and mouse m(6)A modification landscape in a transcriptome-wide manner, using a novel approach, m(6)A-seq, based on antibody-mediated capture and massively parallel sequencing. We identify over 12,000 m(6)A sites characterized by a typical consensus in the transcripts of more than 7,000 human genes. Sites preferentially appear in two distinct landmarks--around stop codons and within long internal exons--and are highly conserved between human and mouse. Although most sites are well preserved across normal and cancerous tissues and in response to various stimuli, a subset of stimulus-dependent, dynamically modulated sites is identified. Silencing the m(6)A methyltransferase significantly affects gene expression and alternative splicing patterns, resulting in modulation of the p53 (also known as TP53) signalling pathway and apoptosis. Our findings therefore suggest that RNA decoration by m(6)A has a fundamental role in regulation of gene expression.},

Pol II accumulates immediately downstream of promoters, at intron-exon junctions that are efficiently used for splicing, and over 3' polyadenylation sites. Focused analyses of promoters reveal that pausing is not fixed relative to initiation sites, nor is it specified directly by the position of a particular core promoter element or the first nucleosome. Core promoter elements function beyond initiation, and when optimally positioned they act collectively to dictate the position and strength of pausing.

TT-seq analysis shows that enhancer RNAs are short-lived and lack U1 motifs and secondary structure. TT-seq also maps transient RNA downstream of polyadenylation sites and uncovers sites of transcription termination; we found, on average, four transcription termination sites, distributed in a window with a median width of ~3300 base pairs.

  abstract        = {RNA splicing is an essential part of eukaryotic gene expression. Although the mechanism of splicing has been extensively studied in vitro, in vivo kinetics for the two-step splicing reaction remain poorly understood. Here, we combine transient transcriptome sequencing (TT-seq) and mathematical modeling to quantify RNA metabolic rates at donor and acceptor splice sites across the human genome. Splicing occurs in the range of minutes and is limited by the speed of RNA polymerase elongation. Splicing kinetics strongly depends on the position and nature of nucleotides flanking splice sites, and on structural interactions between unspliced RNA and small nuclear RNAs in spliceosomal intermediates. Finally, we introduce the 'yield' of splicing as the efficiency of converting unspliced to spliced RNA and show that it is highest for mRNAs and independent of splicing kinetics. These results lead to quantitative models describing how splicing rates and yield are encoded in the human genome.},

Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases. To align our large (>80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy. STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code. STAR is free open source software distributed under GPLv3 license and can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/rna-star/.},

We use HISAT2 to represent and search an expanded model of the human reference genome in which over 14.5 million genomic variants in combination with haplotypes are incorporated into the data structure used for searching and alignment. We benchmark HISAT2 using simulated and real datasets to demonstrate that our strategy of representing a population of genomes, together with a fast, memory-efficient search algorithm, provides more detailed and accurate variant analyses than other methods. We apply HISAT2 for HLA typing and DNA fingerprinting; both applications form part of the HISAT-genotype software that enables analysis of haplotype-resolved genes or genomic regions.

Among these modifications, (cytosine-5) DNA methylation is best known for its role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Post-transcriptional RNA modification is a characteristic feature of noncoding RNAs, and has been described for rRNAs, tRNAs and miRNAs. (Cytosine-5) RNA methylation has been detected in stable and long-lived RNA molecules, but its function is still unclear, mainly due to technical limitations. In order to facilitate the analysis of RNA methylation patterns we have established a protocol for the chemical deamination of cytosines in RNA, followed by PCR-based amplification of cDNA and DNA sequencing. Using tRNAs and rRNAs as examples we show that cytosine methylation can be reproducibly and quantitatively detected by bisulfite sequencing. The combination of this method with deep sequencing allowed the analysis of a large number of RNA molecules. These results establish a versatile method for the identification and characterization of RNA methylation patterns, which will be useful for defining the biological function of RNA methylation.},

  abstract        = {Transcriptomics technologies are the techniques used to study an organism's transcriptome, the sum of all of its RNA transcripts. The information content of an organism is recorded in the DNA of its genome and expressed through transcription. Here, mRNA serves as a transient intermediary molecule in the information network, whilst noncoding RNAs perform additional diverse functions. A transcriptome captures a snapshot in time of the total transcripts present in a cell. The first attempts to study the whole transcriptome began in the early 1990s, and technological advances since the late 1990s have made transcriptomics a widespread discipline. Transcriptomics has been defined by repeated technological innovations that transform the field. There are two key contemporary techniques in the field: microarrays, which quantify a set of predetermined sequences, and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), which uses high-throughput sequencing to capture all sequences. Measuring the expression of an organism's genes in different tissues, conditions, or time points gives information on how genes are regulated and reveals details of an organism's biology. It can also help to infer the functions of previously unannotated genes. Transcriptomic analysis has enabled the study of how gene expression changes in different organisms and has been instrumental in the understanding of human disease. An analysis of gene expression in its entirety allows detection of broad coordinated trends which cannot be discerned by more targeted assays.},

In particular, for non-model organisms and in the absence of an appropriate reference genome, RNA-Seq is used to reconstruct the transcriptome de novo. Although the de novo transcriptome assembly of non-model organisms has been on the rise recently and new tools are frequently developing, there is still a knowledge gap about which assembly software should be used to build a comprehensive de novo assembly. Here, we present a large-scale comparative study in which 10 de novo assembly tools are applied to 9 RNA-Seq data sets spanning different kingdoms of life. Overall, we built >200 single assemblies and evaluated their performance on a combination of 20 biological-based and reference-free metrics. Our study is accompanied by a comprehensive and extensible Electronic Supplement that summarizes all data sets, assembly execution instructions, and evaluation results. Trinity, SPAdes, and Trans-ABySS, followed by Bridger and SOAPdenovo-Trans, generally outperformed the other tools compared. Moreover, we observed species-specific differences in the performance of each assembler. No tool delivered the best results for all data sets. We recommend a careful choice and normalization of evaluation metrics to select the best assembling results as a critical step in the reconstruction of a comprehensive de novo transcriptome assembly.},

  abstract     = {The main challenge in de novo genome assembly of DNA-seq data is certainly to deal with repeats that are longer than the reads. In de novo transcriptome assembly of RNA-seq reads, on the other hand, this problem has been underestimated so far. Even though we have fewer and shorter repeated sequences in transcriptomics, they do create ambiguities and confuse assemblers if not addressed properly. Most transcriptome assemblers of short reads are based on de Bruijn graphs (DBG) and have no clear and explicit model for repeats in RNA-seq data, relying instead on heuristics to deal with them. The results of this work are threefold. First, we introduce a formal model for representing high copy-number and low-divergence repeats in RNA-seq data and exploit its properties to infer a combinatorial characteristic of repeat-associated subgraphs. We show that the problem of identifying such subgraphs in a DBG is NP-complete. Second, we show that in the specific case of local assembly of alternative splicing (AS) events, we can   avoid such subgraphs, and we present an efficient algorithm to enumerate AS events that are not included in repeats. Using simulated data, we show that this strategy is significantly more sensitive and precise than the previous version of KisSplice (Sacomoto et al. in WABI, pp 99-111, 1), Trinity (Grabherr et al. in Nat Biotechnol 29(7):644-652, 2), and Oases (Schulz et al. in Bioinformatics 28(8):1086-1092, 3), for the specific task of calling AS events. Third, we turn our focus to full-length transcriptome assembly, and we show that exploring the topology of DBGs can improve de novo transcriptome evaluation methods. Based on the observation that repeats create complicated regions in a DBG, and when assemblers try to traverse these regions, they can infer erroneous transcripts, we propose a measure to flag transcripts traversing such troublesome regions, thereby giving a confidence level for each transcript. The originality of our work when compared to other transcriptome evaluation methods is that we use only the topology of the DBG, and not read nor coverage information. We show that our simple method gives better results than Rsem-Eval (Li et al. in Genome Biol 15(12):553, 4) and TransRate (Smith-Unna et al. in Genome Res 26(8):1134-1144, 5) on both real and simulated datasets for detecting chimeras, and therefore is able to capture assembly errors missed by these methods.},

  abstract        = {Of the diverse analytical tools used in proteomics, protein microarrays possess the greatest potential for providing fundamental information on protein, ligand, analyte, receptor, and antibody affinity-based interactions, binding partners and high-throughput analysis. Microarrays have been used to develop tools for drug screening, disease diagnosis, biochemical pathway mapping, protein-protein interaction analysis, vaccine development, enzyme-substrate profiling, and immuno-profiling. While the promise of the technology is intriguing, it is yet to be realized. Many challenges remain to be addressed to allow these methods to meet technical and research expectations, provide reliable assay answers, and to reliably diversify their capabilities. Critical issues include: (1) inconsistent printed microspot morphologies and uniformities, (2) low signal-to-noise ratios due to factors such as complex surface capture protocols, contamination, and static or no-flow mass transport conditions, (3) inconsistent quantification of captured signal due to spot uniformity issues, (4) non-optimal protocol conditions such as pH, temperature, drying that promote variability in assay kinetics, and lastly (5) poor protein (e.g., antibody) printing, storage, or shelf-life compatibility with common microarray assay fabrication methods, directly related to microarray protocols. Conventional printing approaches, including contact (e.g., quill and solid pin), non-contact (e.g., piezo and inkjet), microfluidics-based, microstamping, lithography, and cell-free protein expression microarrays, have all been used with varying degrees of success with figures of merit often defined arbitrarily without comparisons to standards, or analytical or fiduciary controls. Many microarray performance reports use bench top analyte preparations lacking real-world relevance, akin to "fishing in a barrel", for proof of concept and determinations of figures of merit. This review critiques current protein-based microarray preparation techniques commonly used for analytical and function-based proteomics and their effects on array-based assay performance.},

Contact printing is a widely used technology, comprising methods such as contact pin printing and microstamping. These methods have many advantages, including reproducibility of printed spots and facile maintenance, as well as drawbacks, including low-throughput fabrication of arrays. Non-contact printing techniques are newer and more varied, comprising photochemistry-based methods, laser writing, electrospray deposition, and inkjet technologies. These technologies emerged from other applications and have the potential to increase microarray fabrication throughput; however, there are several challenges in applying them to microarray fabrication, including interference from satellite drops and biomolecule denaturization.},

Recently, RNA-seq has looked likely to replace microarrays, but there will be a period where both technologies co-exist. This raises two important questions: Can microarray-based models and biomarkers be directly applied to RNA-seq data? Can future RNA-seq-based predictive models and biomarkers be applied to microarray data to leverage past investment? We systematically evaluated the transferability of predictive models and signature genes between microarray and RNA-seq using two large clinical data sets. The complexity of cross-platform sequence correspondence was considered in the analysis and examined using three human and two rat data sets, and three levels of mapping complexity were revealed. Three algorithms representing different modeling complexity were applied to the three levels of mappings for each of the eight binary endpoints and Cox regression was used to model survival times with expression data. In total, 240,096 predictive models were examined. Signature genes of predictive models are reciprocally transferable between microarray and RNA-seq data for model development, and microarray-based models can accurately predict RNA-seq-profiled samples; while RNA-seq-based models are less accurate in predicting microarray-profiled samples and are affected both by the choice of modeling algorithm and the gene mapping complexity. The results suggest continued usefulness of legacy microarray data and established microarray biomarkers and predictive models in the forthcoming RNA-seq era.},

We abandon the classical "overlap-layout-consensus" approach in favor of a new euler algorithm that, for the first time, resolves the 20-year-old "repeat problem" in fragment assembly. Our main result is the reduction of the fragment assembly to a variation of the classical Eulerian path problem that allows one to generate accurate solutions of large-scale sequencing problems. euler, in contrast to the celera assembler, does not mask such repeats but uses them instead as a powerful fragment assembly tool.},

Here we present the Trinity method for de novo assembly of full-length transcripts and evaluate it on samples from fission yeast, mouse and whitefly, whose reference genome is not yet available. By efficiently constructing and analyzing sets of de Bruijn graphs, Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments.

Single-molecule long-read sequencing has the potential to dramatically advance the field, although high error rates are a challenge with existing methods. Addressing this need, we introduce open-source methods for long-read alignment (NGMLR; https://github.com/philres/ngmlr ) and structural variant identification (Sniffles; https://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/Sniffles ) that provide unprecedented sensitivity and precision for variant detection, even in repeat-rich regions and for complex nested events that can have substantial effects on human health. In several long-read datasets, including healthy and cancerous human genomes, we discovered thousands of novel variants and categorized systematic errors in short-read approaches. NGMLR and Sniffles can automatically filter false events and operate on low-coverage data, thereby reducing the high costs that have hindered the application of long reads in clinical and research settings.},

  abstract   = {The approximate string matching problem is to find all locations at which a query of lengthm matches a substring of a text of length n with k-or-fewer differences. Simple and practical bit-vector algorithms have been designed for this problem, most notably the one used in agrep. These algorithms compute a bit representation of the current state-set of the k-difference automaton for the query, and asymptotically run in either O(nm/w) or O(nm log σ/w) time where w is the word size of the machine (e.g., 32 or 64 in practice), and σ is the size of the pattern alphabet. Here we present an algorithm of comparable simplicity that requires only O(nm/w) time by virtue of computing a bit representation of the relocatable dynamic programming matrix for the problem. Thus, the algorithm's performance is independent of k, and it is found to be more efficient than the previous results for many choices of k and smallm.Moreover, because the algorithm is not dependent on k, it can be used to rapidly compute blocks of the dynamic programming matrix as in the 4-Russians algorithm of Wu et al.(1996). This gives rise to an O(kn/w) expected-time algorithm for the case where m may be arbitrarily large. In practice this new algorithm, that computes a region of the dynamic progr amming (d.p.) matrx w entries at a time using the basic algorithm as a subroutine is significantly faster than our previous 4-Russians algorithm, that computes the same region 4 or 5 entries at a time using table lookup. This performance improvement yields a code that is either superior or competitive with all existing algorithms except for some filtration algorithms that are superior when k/m is sufficiently small.},

Our method is based upon a fast read mapping technique, separate thorough alignment methods for regular letter-space as well as AB SOLiD (color-space) reads, and a statistical model for false positive hits. We use SHRiMP to map reads from a newly sequenced Ciona savignyi individual to the reference genome. We demonstrate that SHRiMP can accurately map reads to this highly polymorphic genome, while confirming high heterozygosity of C. savignyi in this second individual.

However, current software for aligning RNA-Seq data to a genome relies on known splice junctions and cannot identify novel ones. TopHat is an efficient read-mapping algorithm designed to align reads from an RNA-Seq experiment to a reference genome without relying on known splice sites. We mapped the RNA-Seq reads from a recent mammalian RNA-Seq experiment and recovered more than 72% of the splice junctions reported by the annotation-based software from that study, along with nearly 20,000 previously unreported junctions. The TopHat pipeline is much faster than previous systems, mapping nearly 2.2 million reads per CPU hour, which is sufficient to process an entire RNA-Seq experiment in less than a day on a standard desktop computer. We describe several challenges unique to ab initio splice site discovery from RNA-Seq reads that will require further algorithm development.

Tests on real and simulated data sets showed that HISAT is the fastest system currently available, with equal or better accuracy than any other method.

  abstract        = {Next-generation sequencing captures sequence differences in reads relative to a reference genome or transcriptome, including splicing events and complex variants involving multiple mismatches and long indels. We present computational methods for fast detection of complex variants and splicing in short reads, based on a successively constrained search process of merging and filtering position lists from a genomic index. Our methods are implemented in GSNAP (Genomic Short-read Nucleotide Alignment Program), which can align both single- and paired-end reads as short as 14 nt and of arbitrarily long length. It can detect short- and long-distance splicing, including interchromosomal splicing, in individual reads, using probabilistic models or a database of known splice sites. Our program also permits SNP-tolerant alignment to a reference space of all possible combinations of major and minor alleles, and can align reads from bisulfite-treated DNA for the study of methylation state. In comparison testing, GSNAP has speeds comparable to existing programs, especially in reads of > or=70 nt and is fastest in detecting complex variants with four or more mismatches or insertions of 1-9 nt and deletions of 1-30 nt. Although SNP tolerance does not increase alignment yield substantially, it affects alignment results in 7-8% of transcriptional reads, typically by revealing alternate genomic mappings for a read. Simulations of bisulfite-converted DNA show a decrease in identifying genomic positions uniquely in 6% of 36 nt reads and 3% of 70 nt reads.

Because RNA represents the direct output of the genetic information encoded by genomes and a significant proportion of a cell's regulatory capabilities are focused on its synthesis, processing, transport, modification and translation, the generation of such a catalogue is crucial for understanding genome function. Here we report evidence that three-quarters of the human genome is capable of being transcribed, as well as observations about the range and levels of expression, localization, processing fates, regulatory regions and modifications of almost all currently annotated and thousands of previously unannotated RNAs. These observations, taken together, prompt a redefinition of the concept of a gene.},

To date, no one has developed a unified methodology for aligning converted sequences and consolidating alignment of these technologies in one package. In this paper, we describe hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of transcripts-3 nucleotides (HISAT-3N), which can rapidly and accurately align sequences consisting of any nucleotide conversion by leveraging the powerful hierarchical index and repeat index algorithms originally developed for the HISAT software. Tests on real and simulated data sets show that HISAT-3N is faster than other modern systems, with greater alignment accuracy, higher scalability, and smaller memory requirements. HISAT-3N therefore becomes an ideal aligner when used with converted sequence technologies.},

We report a genomic sequencing method that provides positive identification of 5-methylcytosine residues and yields strand-specific sequences of individual molecules in genomic DNA. The method utilizes bisulfite-induced modification of genomic DNA, under conditions whereby cytosine is converted to uracil, but 5-methylcytosine remains nonreactive. The sequence under investigation is then amplified by PCR with two sets of strand-specific primers to yield a pair of fragments, one from each strand, in which all uracil and thymine residues have been amplified as thymine and only 5-methylcytosine residues have been amplified as cytosine. The PCR products can be sequenced directly to provide a strand-specific average sequence for the population of molecules or can be cloned and sequenced to provide methylation maps of single DNA molecules. We tested the method by defining the methylation status within single DNA strands of two closely spaced CpG dinucleotides in the promoter of the human kininogen gene. During the analysis, we encountered in sperm DNA an unusual methylation pattern, which suggests that the high methylation level of single-copy sequences in sperm may be locally modulated by binding of protein factors in germ-line cells.},

However, detection of this modification was limited to specific, abundant, RNA species, due to the usage of low-throughput methods. To obtain a high resolution, systematic, and comprehensive transcriptome-wide overview of m(5)C across the three domains of life, we used bisulfite treatment on total RNA from both gram positive (B. subtilis) and gram negative (E. coli) bacteria, an archaeon (S. solfataricus) and a eukaryote (S. cerevisiae), followed by massively parallel sequencing. We were able to recover most previously documented m(5)C sites on rRNA in the four organisms, and identified several novel sites in yeast and archaeal rRNAs. Our analyses also allowed quantification of methylated m(5)C positions in 64 tRNAs in yeast and archaea, revealing stoichiometric differences between the methylation patterns of these organisms. Molecules of tRNAs in which m(5)C was absent were also discovered. Intriguingly, we detected m(5)C sites within archaeal mRNAs, and identified a consensus motif of AUCGANGU that directs methylation in S. solfataricus. Our results, which were validated using m(5)C-specific RNA immunoprecipitation, provide the first evidence for mRNA modifications in archaea, suggesting that this mode of post-transcriptional regulation extends beyond the eukaryotic domain.},

Previous studies failed to detect 5-methylcytosine in Dictyostelium genomic DNA, but the recent sequencing of the Dictyostelium genome revealed a candidate DNA methyltransferase gene (dnmA). The genome sequence also uncovered an unusual distribution of potential methylation sites, CpG islands, throughout the genome. DnmA belongs to the Dnmt2 subfamily and contains all the catalytic motifs necessary for cytosine methyltransferases. Dnmt2 activity is typically weak in Drosophila melanogaster, mouse, and human cells and the gene function in these systems is unknown. We have investigated the methylation status of Dictyostelium genomic DNA with antibodies raised against 5-methylcytosine and detected low levels of the modified nucleotide. We also found that DNA methylation increased during development. We searched the genome for potential methylation sites and found them in retrotransposable elements and in several other genes. Using Southern blot analysis with methylation-sensitive and -insensitive restriction endonucleases, we found that the DIRS retrotransposon and the guaB gene were indeed methylated. We then mutated the dnmA gene and found that DNA methylation was reduced to about 50% of the wild-type level. The mutant cells exhibited morphological defects in late development, indicating that DNA methylation has a regulatory role in Dictyostelium development. Our findings establish a role for a Dnmt2 methyltransferase in eukaryotic development.},

We have developed BS Seeker, an approach that converts the genome to a three-letter alphabet and uses Bowtie to align bisulfite-treated reads to a reference genome. It uses sequence tags to reduce mapping ambiguity. Post-processing of the alignments removes non-unique and low-quality mappings. We tested our aligner on synthetic data, a bisulfite-converted Arabidopsis library, and human libraries generated from two different experimental protocols. We evaluated the performance of our approach and compared it to other bisulfite aligners. The results demonstrate that among the aligners tested, BS Seeker is more versatile and faster. When mapping to the human genome, BS Seeker generates alignments significantly faster than RMAP and BSMAP. Furthermore, BS Seeker is the only alignment tool that can explicitly account for tags which are generated by certain library construction protocols. BS Seeker provides fast and accurate mapping of bisulfite-converted reads. It can work with BS reads generated from the two different experimental protocols, and is able to efficiently map reads to large mammalian genomes.

However, there are challenges in handling and interpretation of the methylation sequence data because of its large volume and the consequences of bisulphite modification. We sequenced reduced representation human genomes on the Illumina platform and efficiently mapped and visualized the data with different pipelines and software packages. We examined three pipelines for aligning bisulphite converted sequencing reads and compared their performance. We also comment on pre-processing and quality control of Illumina data. This comparison highlights differences in methods for NGS data processing and provides guidance to advance sequence-based methylation data analysis for molecular biologists.},

The four most frequently used sequencing-based technologies are the bisulfite-based methods MethylC-seq and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), and the enrichment-based techniques methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) and methylated DNA binding domain sequencing (MBD-seq). We applied all four methods to biological replicates of human embryonic stem cells to assess their genome-wide CpG coverage, resolution, cost, concordance and the influence of CpG density and genomic context. The methylation levels assessed by the two bisulfite methods were concordant (their difference did not exceed a given threshold) for 82% for CpGs and 99% of the non-CpG cytosines. Using binary methylation calls, the two enrichment methods were 99% concordant and regions assessed by all four methods were 97% concordant. We combined MeDIP-seq with methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme (MRE-seq) sequencing for comprehensive methylome coverage at lower cost. This, along with RNA-seq and ChIP-seq of the ES cells enabled us to detect regions with allele-specific epigenetic states, identifying most known imprinted regions and new loci with monoallelic epigenetic marks and monoallelic expression.},

  abstract        = {The rapid evolution in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies has opened up new perspectives in several research fields and led to the production of large volumes of sequence data. A fundamental step in HTS data analysis is the mapping of reads onto reference sequences. Choosing a suitable mapper for a given technology and a given application is a subtle task because of the difficulty of evaluating mapping algorithms. In this paper, we present a benchmark procedure to compare mapping algorithms used in HTS using both real and simulated datasets and considering four evaluation criteria: computational resource and time requirements, robustness of mapping, ability to report positions for reads in repetitive regions, and ability to retrieve true genetic variation positions. To measure robustness, we introduced a new definition for a correctly mapped read taking into account not only the expected start position of the read but also the end position and the number of indels and substitutions. We developed CuReSim, a new read simulator, that is able to generate customized benchmark data for any kind of HTS technology by adjusting parameters to the error types. CuReSim and CuReSimEval, a tool to evaluate the mapping quality of the CuReSim simulated reads, are freely available. We applied our benchmark procedure to evaluate 14 mappers in the context of whole genome sequencing of small genomes with Ion Torrent data for which such a comparison has not yet been established. A benchmark procedure to compare HTS data mappers is introduced with a new definition for the mapping correctness as well as tools to generate simulated reads and evaluate mapping quality. The application of this procedure to Ion Torrent data from the whole genome sequencing of small genomes has allowed us to validate our benchmark procedure and demonstrate that it is helpful for selecting a mapper based on the intended application, questions to be addressed, and the technology used. This benchmark procedure can be used to evaluate existing or in-development mappers as well as to optimize parameters of a chosen mapper for any application and any sequencing platform.},

In research, sequencing is being applied not only to assemble genomes and to investigate the genetic basis of human disease, but also to explore myriad phenomena in organismic and cellular biology. In the clinic, the utility of sequence data is being intensively evaluated in diverse contexts, including reproductive medicine, oncology and infectious disease. A recurrent theme in the development of new sequencing applications is the creative 'recombination' of existing experimental building blocks. However, there remain many potentially high-impact applications of next-generation DNA sequencing that are not yet fully realized.},

  abstract        = {High-throughput next generation sequencing technologies have enabled rapid characterization of clinical and environmental samples. Consequently, the largest bottleneck to actionable data has become sample processing and bioinformatics analysis, creating a need for accurate and rapid algorithms to process genetic data. Perfectly characterized in silico datasets are a useful tool for evaluating the performance of such algorithms. Background contaminating organisms are observed in sequenced mixtures of organisms. In silico samples provide exact truth. To create the best value for evaluating algorithms, in silico data should mimic actual sequencer data as closely as possible. FASTQSim is a tool that provides the dual functionality of NGS dataset characterization and metagenomic data generation. FASTQSim is sequencing platform-independent, and computes distributions of read length, quality scores, indel rates, single point mutation rates, indel size, and similar statistics for any sequencing platform. To create training or testing datasets, FASTQSim has the ability to convert target sequences into in silico reads with specific error profiles obtained in the characterization step. FASTQSim enables users to assess the quality of NGS datasets. The tool provides information about read length, read quality, repetitive and non-repetitive indel profiles, and single base pair substitutions. FASTQSim allows the user to simulate individual read datasets that can be used as standardized test scenarios for planning sequencing projects or for benchmarking metagenomic software. In this regard, in silico datasets generated with the FASTQsim tool hold several advantages over natural datasets: they are sequencing platform independent, extremely well characterized, and less expensive to generate. Such datasets are valuable in a number of applications, including the training of assemblers for multiple platforms, benchmarking bioinformatics algorithm performance, and creating challenge datasets for detecting genetic engineering toolmarks, etc.},

Therefore, a direct necessity of specific simulation tools for testing and benchmarking is rising, such as a flexible and portable FASTQ read simulator, without the need of a reference sequence, yet correctly prepared for producing approximately the same characteristics as real data. We present XS, a skilled FASTQ read simulation tool, flexible, portable (does not need a reference sequence) and tunable in terms of sequence complexity. It has several running modes, depending on the time and memory available, and is aimed at testing computing infrastructures, namely cloud computing of large-scale projects, and testing FASTQ compression algorithms. Moreover, XS offers the possibility of simulating the three main FASTQ components individually (headers, DNA sequences and quality-scores). XS provides an efficient and convenient method for fast simulation of FASTQ files, such as those from Ion Torrent (currently uncovered by other simulators), Roche-454, Illumina and ABI-SOLiD sequencing machines. This tool is publicly available at http://bioinformatics.ua.pt/software/xs/.},

These technologies now routinely produce reads exceeding 5,000 basepairs, and can achieve reads as long as 50,000 basepairs. Here we evaluate the limits of single molecule sequencing by assessing the impact of long read sequencing in the assembly of the human genome and 25 other important genomes across the tree of life. From this, we develop a new data-driven model using support vector regression that can accurately predict assembly performance. We also present a novel hybrid error correction algorithm for long PacBio sequencing reads that uses pre-assembled Illumina sequences for the error correction. We apply it several prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, and show it can achieve near-perfect assemblies of small genomes (\&lt; 100Mbp) and substantially improved assemblies of larger ones.

We describe the Assemblathon 1 competition, which aimed to comprehensively assess the state of the art in de novo assembly methods when applied to current sequencing technologies. In a collaborative effort, teams were asked to assemble a simulated Illumina HiSeq data set of an unknown, simulated diploid genome. A total of 41 assemblies from 17 different groups were received. Novel haplotype aware assessments of coverage, contiguity, structure, base calling, and copy number were made. We establish that within this benchmark: (1) It is possible to assemble the genome to a high level of coverage and accuracy, and that (2) large differences exist between the assemblies, suggesting room for further improvements in current methods. The simulated benchmark, including the correct answer, the assemblies, and the code that was used to evaluate the assemblies is now public and freely available from http://www.assemblathon.org/.},

Perceived diversity, however, can be influenced by sample preparation, primer selection, and formation of chimeric 16S amplification products. Chimeras are hybrid products between multiple parent sequences that can be falsely interpreted as novel organisms, thus inflating apparent diversity. We developed a new chimera detection tool called Chimera Slayer (CS). CS detects chimeras with greater sensitivity than previous methods, performs well on short sequences such as those produced by the 454 Life Sciences (Roche) Genome Sequencer, and can scale to large data sets. By benchmarking CS performance against sequences derived from a controlled DNA mixture of known organisms and a simulated chimera set, we provide insights into the factors that affect chimera formation such as sequence abundance, the extent of similarity between 16S genes, and PCR conditions. Chimeras were found to reproducibly form among independent amplifications and contributed to false perceptions of sample diversity and the false identification of novel taxa, with less-abundant species exhibiting chimera rates exceeding 70%. Shotgun metagenomic sequences of our mock community appear to be devoid of 16S chimeras, supporting a role for shotgun metagenomics in validating novel organisms discovered in targeted sequence surveys.},

These technologies are likely to revolutionize genetics and biomedical research, but a thorough characterization of the ultra-short read output is necessary. We generated and analyzed two Illumina 1G ultra-short read data sets, i.e. 2.8 million 27mer reads from a Beta vulgaris genomic clone and 12.3 million 36mers from the Helicobacter acinonychis genome. We found that error rates range from 0.3% at the beginning of reads to 3.8% at the end of reads. Wrong base calls are frequently preceded by base G. Base substitution error frequencies vary by 10- to 11-fold, with A > C transversion being among the most frequent and C > G transversions among the least frequent substitution errors. Insertions and deletions of single bases occur at very low rates. When simulating re-sequencing we found a 20-fold sequencing coverage to be sufficient to compensate errors by correct reads. The read coverage of the sequenced regions is biased; the highest read density was found in intervals with elevated GC content. High Solexa quality scores are over-optimistic and low scores underestimate the data quality. Our results show different types of biases and ways to detect them. Such biases have implications on the use and interpretation of Solexa data, for de novo sequencing, re-sequencing, the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms and DNA methylation sites, as well as for transcriptome analysis.},

The 454 GS Junior (Roche), MiSeq (Illumina) and Ion Torrent PGM (Life Technologies) are laser-printer sized and offer modest set-up and running costs. Each instrument can generate data required for a draft bacterial genome sequence in days, making them attractive for identifying and characterizing pathogens in the clinical setting. We compared the performance of these instruments by sequencing an isolate of Escherichia coli O104:H4, which caused an outbreak of food poisoning in Germany in 2011. The MiSeq had the highest throughput per run (1.6 Gb/run, 60 Mb/h) and lowest error rates. The 454 GS Junior generated the longest reads (up to 600 bases) and most contiguous assemblies but had the lowest throughput (70 Mb/run, 9 Mb/h). Run in 100-bp mode, the Ion Torrent PGM had the highest throughput (80–100 Mb/h). Unlike the MiSeq, the Ion Torrent PGM and 454 GS Junior both produced homopolymer-associated indel errors (1.5 and 0.38 errors per 100 bases, respectively).},

Currently, there is no available simulator that targets the specific generation of PacBio libraries. Our analysis of 13 PacBio datasets showed characteristic features of PacBio reads (e.g. the read length of PacBio reads follows a log-normal distribution). We have developed a read simulator, PBSIM, that captures these features using either a model-based or sampling-based method. Using PBSIM, we conducted several hybrid error correction and assembly tests for PacBio reads, suggesting that a continuous long reads coverage depth of at least 15 in combination with a circular consensus sequencing coverage depth of at least 30 achieved extensive assembly results.

DRISEE provides positional error estimates that can be used to inform read trimming within a sample. It also provides global (whole sample) error estimates that can be used to identify samples with high or varying levels of sequencing error that may confound downstream analyses, particularly in the case of studies that utilize data from multiple sequencing samples. For shotgun metagenomic data, we believe that DRISEE provides estimates of sequencing error that are more accurate and less constrained by technical limitations than existing methods that rely on reference genomes or the use of scores (e.g. Phred). Here, DRISEE is applied to (non amplicon) data sets from both the 454 and Illumina platforms. The DRISEE error estimate is obtained by analyzing sets of artifactual duplicate reads (ADRs), a known by-product of both sequencing platforms. We present DRISEE as an open-source, platform-independent method to assess sequencing error in shotgun metagenomic data, and utilize it to discover previously uncharacterized error in de novo sequence data from the 454 and Illumina sequencing platforms.},

As a result, current large-scale sequencing output, while impressive, is not adequate to keep pace with growing demand and, in particular, is far short of what will be required to obtain the 3-billion-base human genome sequence by the target date of 2005. To reach this goal, improved automation will be essential, and it is particularly important that human involvement in sequence data processing be significantly reduced or eliminated. Progress in this respect will require both improved accuracy of the data processing software and reliable accuracy measures to reduce the need for human involvement in error correction and make human review more efficient. Here, we describe one step toward that goal: a base-calling program for automated sequencer traces, phred, with improved accuracy. phred appears to be the first base-calling program to achieve a lower error rate than the ABI software, averaging 40%-50% fewer errors in the data sets examined independent of position in read, machine running conditions, or sequencing chemistry.},

Study design of sequencing projects would benefit from being able to simulate experiments. We explore 454 raw data to investigate its characteristics and derive empirical distributions for the flow values generated by pyrosequencing. Based on our findings, we implement Flowsim, a simulator that generates realistic pyrosequencing data files of arbitrary size from a given set of input DNA sequences. We finally use our simulator to examine the impact of sequence lengths on the results of concrete whole-genome assemblies, and we suggest its use in planning of sequencing projects, benchmarking of assembly methods and other fields.

In the last five years, computational biologists and bioinformatics specialists have come up with newer, better and more efficient tools towards the discovery, analysis and interpretation of different genomic variants from high-throughput sequencing data. Availability of reliable simulated dataset is essential and is the first step towards testing any newly developed analytical tools for variant discovery. Although there are tools currently available that can simulate variants, none present the possibility of simulating all the three major types of variations (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, Insertions and Deletions and Copy Number Variations) and can generate reads taking a realistic error-model into consideration. Therefore, an efficient simulator and read generator is needed that can simulate variants taking the error rates of true biological samples into consideration. We report SInC (Snp, Indel and Cnv) an open-source variant simulator and read generator capable of simulating all the three common types of biological variants taking into account a distribution of base quality score from a most commonly used next-generation sequencing instrument from Illumina. SInC is capable of generating single- and paired-end reads with user-defined insert size and with high efficiency compared to the other existing tools. SInC, due to its multi-threaded capability during read generation, has a low time footprint. SInC is currently optimised to work in limited infrastructure setup and can efficiently exploit the commonly used quad-core desktop architecture to simulate short sequence reads with deep coverage for large genomes. We have come up with a user-friendly multi-variant simulator and read-generator tools called SInC. SInC can be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/sincsimulator.},

These include regional GC content, preferential sites of fragmentation, and read "pile-up" due to primer affinity and transcript end effects. Independent of cell type and laboratory, when ignored, these factors can bias analyses. Understanding the underlying principles responsible for producing these artifacts is key to recognizing both their presence and how their effects may be controlled.

This bias can dominate the signal of interest for analyses that focus on measuring fragment abundance within a genome, such as copy number estimation (DNA-seq). The bias is not consistent between samples; and there is no consensus as to the best methods to remove it in a single sample. We analyze regularities in the GC bias patterns, and find a compact description for this unimodal curve family. It is the GC content of the full DNA fragment, not only the sequenced read, that most influences fragment count. This GC effect is unimodal: both GC-rich fragments and AT-rich fragments are underrepresented in the sequencing results. This empirical evidence strengthens the hypothesis that PCR is the most important cause of the GC bias. We propose a model that produces predictions at the base pair level, allowing strand-specific GC-effect correction regardless of the downstream smoothing or binning. These GC modeling considerations can inform other high-throughput sequencing analyses such as ChIP-seq and RNA-seq.},

  abstract        = {RNA-Seq is revolutionizing the way transcript abundances are measured. A key challenge in transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data is the handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is particularly important for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult to determine which transcripts are isoforms of the same gene. A second significant issue is the design of RNA-Seq experiments, in terms of the number of reads, read length, and whether reads come from one or both ends of cDNA fragments. We present RSEM, an user-friendly software package for quantifying gene and isoform abundances from single-end or paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM outputs abundance estimates, 95% credibility intervals, and visualization files and can also simulate RNA-Seq data. In contrast to other existing tools, the software does not require a reference genome. Thus, in combination with a de novo transcriptome assembler, RSEM enables accurate transcript quantification for species without sequenced genomes. On simulated and real data sets, RSEM has superior or comparable performance to quantification methods that rely on a reference genome. Taking advantage of RSEM's ability to effectively use ambiguously-mapping reads, we show that accurate gene-level abundance estimates are best obtained with large numbers of short single-end reads. On the other hand, estimates of the relative frequencies of isoforms within single genes may be improved through the use of paired-end reads, depending on the number of possible splice forms for each gene. RSEM is an accurate and user-friendly software tool for quantifying transcript abundances from RNA-Seq data. As it does not rely on the existence of a reference genome, it is particularly useful for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies. In addition, RSEM has enabled valuable guidance for cost-efficient design of quantification experiments with RNA-Seq, which is currently relatively expensive.},

  abstract        = {A critical task in high-throughput sequencing is aligning millions of short reads to a reference genome. Alignment is especially complicated for RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) because of RNA splicing. A number of RNA-Seq algorithms are available, and claim to align reads with high accuracy and efficiency while detecting splice junctions. RNA-Seq data are discrete in nature; therefore, with reasonable gene models and comparative metrics RNA-Seq data can be simulated to sufficient accuracy to enable meaningful benchmarking of alignment algorithms. The exercise to rigorously compare all viable published RNA-Seq algorithms has not been performed previously. We developed an RNA-Seq simulator that models the main impediments to RNA alignment, including alternative splicing, insertions, deletions, substitutions, sequencing errors and intron signal. We used this simulator to measure the accuracy and robustness of available algorithms at the base and junction levels. Additionally, we used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Sanger sequencing to validate the ability of the algorithms to detect novel transcript features such as novel exons and alternative splicing in RNA-Seq data from mouse retina. A pipeline based on BLAT was developed to explore the performance of established tools for this problem, and to compare it to the recently developed methods. This pipeline, the RNA-Seq Unified Mapper (RUM), performs comparably to the best current aligners and provides an advantageous combination of accuracy, speed and usability. The RUM pipeline is distributed via the Amazon Cloud and for computing clusters using the Sun Grid Engine (http://cbil.upenn.edu/RUM). ggrant@pcbi.upenn.edu; epierce@mail.med.upenn.edu The RNA-Seq sequence reads described in the article are deposited at GEO, accession GSE26248.},

  abstract        = {The accurate interpretation of RNA-Seq data presents a moving target as scientists continue to introduce new experimental techniques and analysis algorithms. Simulated datasets are an invaluable tool to accurately assess the performance of RNA-Seq analysis methods. However, existing RNA-Seq simulators focus on modeling the technical biases and artifacts of sequencing, rather than on simulating the original RNA samples. A first step in simulating RNA-Seq is to simulate RNA. To fill this need, we developed the Configurable And Modular Program Allowing RNA Expression Emulation (CAMPAREE), a simulator using empirical data to simulate diploid RNA samples at the level of individual molecules. We demonstrated CAMPAREE's use for generating idealized coverage plots from real data, and for adding the ability to generate allele-specific data to existing RNA-Seq simulators that do not natively support this feature. Separating input sample modeling from library preparation/sequencing offers added flexibility for both users and developers to mix-and-match different sample and sequencing simulators to suit their specific needs. Furthermore, the ability to maintain sample and sequencing simulators independently provides greater agility to incorporate new biological findings about transcriptomics and new developments in sequencing technologies. Additionally, by simulating at the level of individual molecules, CAMPAREE has the potential to model molecules transcribed from the same genes as a heterogeneous population of transcripts with different states of degradation and processing (splicing, editing, etc.). CAMPAREE was developed in Python, is open source, and freely available at https://github.com/itmat/CAMPAREE .},

Nature, impact and mutual interference of biases in different experimental setups are, however, still poorly understood-mostly due to the lack of data from intermediate protocol steps. We analysed multiple RNA-Seq experiments, involving different sample preparation protocols and sequencing platforms: we broke them down into their common--and currently indispensable--technical components (reverse transcription, fragmentation, adapter ligation, PCR amplification, gel segregation and sequencing), investigating how such different steps influence abundance and distribution of the sequenced reads. For each of those steps, we developed universally applicable models, which can be parameterised by empirical attributes of any experimental protocol. Our models are implemented in a computer simulation pipeline called the Flux Simulator, and we show that read distributions generated by different combinations of these models reproduce well corresponding evidence obtained from the corresponding experimental setups. We further demonstrate that our in silico RNA-Seq provides insights about hidden precursors that determine the final configuration of reads along gene bodies; enhancing or compensatory effects that explain apparently controversial observations can be observed. Moreover, our simulations identify hitherto unreported sources of systematic bias from RNA hydrolysis, a fragmentation technique currently employed by most RNA-Seq protocols.},

As a result, there is an unmet need for a DNA methylation data simulator that can accurately reproduce a wide range of experimental setups, and can be routinely used to compare the performance of different statistical models. We have developed WGBSSuite, a flexible stochastic simulation tool that generates single-base resolution DNA methylation data genome-wide. Several simulator parameters can be derived directly from real datasets provided by the user in order to mimic real case scenarios. Thus, it is possible to choose the most appropriate statistical analysis tool for a given simulated design. To show the usefulness of our simulator, we also report a benchmark of commonly used methods for differential methylation analysis.

In this Review, we discuss the defining properties of gene core promoters, including their sequence features, chromatin architecture and transcription initiation patterns. We provide an overview of molecular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of core promoters and their emerging functional diversity, which defines distinct transcription programmes. On the basis of the established properties of gene core promoters, we discuss transcription start sites within enhancers and integrate recent results obtained from dedicated functional assays to propose a functional model of transcription initiation. This model can explain the nature and function of transcription initiation at gene starts and at enhancers and can explain the different roles of core promoters, of Pol II and its associated factors and of the activating cues provided by enhancers and the transcription factors and cofactors they recruit.},

In mammalian cells, the reaction depends on the sequence AAUAAA upstream of the cleavage site, a degenerate GU-rich sequence element downstream of the cleavage site and stimulatory sequences upstream of AAUAAA. Six factors have been identified that carry out the two reactions. With a single exception, they have been purified to homogeneity and cDNAs for 11 subunits have been cloned. Some of the cooperative RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions within the processing complex have been analyzed, but many details, including the identity of the endonuclease, remain unknown. Several examples of regulated polyadenylation are being analyzed at the molecular level. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, sequences directing cleavage and polyadenylation are more degenerate than in metazoans, and a downstream element has not been identified. The list of processing factors may be complete now with approximately a dozen polypeptides, but their functions in the reaction are largely unknown. 3'-Processing is known to be coupled to transcription. This connection is thought to involve interactions of processing factors with the mRNA cap as well as with RNA polymerase II.},

We report here determination of the stereochemical course of each step using splicing substrates that contained a chiral phosphorothioate. This has provided strong evidence that both steps occur as single 'in-line' SN2 nucleophilic displacement reactions, analogous to the mechanism of group I self-splicing introns. Additionally, because both steps are strongly inhibited by the RP phosphorothioate diastereomer, but not by SP, the spliceosome probably shifts between two active sites in catalysis of the two steps. Chemical and stereochemical similarities suggest that the catalytic site for the second step of spliceosomal processing is related to that of group I self-splicing introns.},

  abstract        = {Splicing of mRNA precursors was discovered over 30 years ago. It is one of the most complex steps in gene expression and therefore must be tightly controlled to ensure that splicing occurs efficiently and accurately. Splicing takes place in a large complex, the spliceosome, which contains approximately 200 proteins and five small RNAs (U snRNAs). Since its discovery, much work has been done to elucidate the pathway of the chemical reaction as well as the proteins and RNAs involved in catalysis. A variety of studies have established the potential for U2 and U6 snRNAs to play a role in splicing catalysis, raising the possibility that the spliceosome is a ribozyme. If correct, this would point to the spliceosomal proteins playing a supporting role during splicing. On the other hand, it may be that proteins contribute more directly to the spliceosomal active site, with the highly evolutionarily conserved Prp8 protein being an excellent candidate. This review will concentrate on recent work on splicing catalysis, and on elucidating the possible roles proteins play in this process.},

Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) and numerous protein factors are essential for the formation of the active spliceosome in which intron excision proceeds in two successive transesterification reactions. Important elements for catalysis are the RNA moieties of the snRNPs that align the pre-mRNA splice sites in the active center of the spliceosome. Although pre-mRNA splicing is almost certainly RNA-mediated, both snRNA-associated proteins and non-snRNP splicing factors participate in each step of the splicing reaction. Splicing proteins exert auxiliary functions in the recognition, selection, and juxtaposition of the splice sites and drive conformational changes during spliceosome assembly and catalysis. Many splicing factors have been isolated in recent years and corresponding cDNAs have been cloned. This review summarizes the structure and function of mammalian proteins which are essential components of the constitutive splicing machinery.},

The number of -omics have been growing ever since, as an analogy from the first genomic studies. Epigenetics refers to the study of changes in gene expression caused by mechanisms other than changes in DNA sequence. Epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone modifications, and, more recently, a variety of noncoding RNAs. Hence, the word epigenomics designates the complete set of epigenetic modifications that occur across the entire genome of a cell at a specific developmental time. Here we review different methodologies to analyze the epigenetic modifications genome-wide (whole methylome and histone-maps), detailing advantages and limitations for each approach.},

RNA epitranscriptomics, the study of RNA modifications, is the new frontier of this arena. Despite being known since the 1970s, eukaryotic RNA modifications were mostly identified on transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA until the last decade, when they have been identified and characterized on mRNA and various non-coding RNAs. Increasing evidence suggests that RNA modification pathways are also misregulated in human cancers and may be ideal targets of cancer therapy. In this Review we highlight the RNA epitranscriptomic pathways implicated in cancer, describing their biological functions and their connections to the disease.},

They are called 'writers', 'readers' and 'erasers'. The identification of RNA modification effectors will be helpful for understanding the regulatory mechanisms and biological functions of RNA modifications. In this work, we developed a database called RNAWRE that specially deposits RNA modification effectors. The current version of RNAWRE stored 2045 manually curated writers, readers and erasers for the six major kinds of RNA modifications, namely Cap, m1A, m6A, m5C, ψ and Poly A. The main modules of RNAWRE not only allow browsing and downloading the RNA modification effectors but also support the BLAST search of the potential RNA modification effectors in other species. We hope that RNAWRE will be helpful for the researches on RNA modifications. Database URL: http://rnawre.bio2db.com.},

The primary function of tRNA as the adaptor of amino acids and the genetic code in protein synthesis is well known. tRNA modifications play multi-faceted roles in decoding and other cellular processes. The abundance, modification, and aminoacylation (charging) levels of tRNAs contribute to mRNA decoding in ways that reflect the cell type and its environment; however, how these factors work together to maximize translation efficiency remains to be understood. tRNAs also interact with many proteins not involved in translation and this may coordinate translation activity and other processes in the cell.

However, they also cluster at functionally important sites of the ribosome, such as the peptidyltransferase center and the decoding site, where they facilitate efficient and accurate protein synthesis. The recent identification of sites of substoichiometric 2'-O-methylation and pseudouridylation has overturned the notion that all rRNA modifications are constitutively present on ribosomes, highlighting nucleotide modifications as an important source of ribosomal heterogeneity. While the mechanisms regulating partial modification and the functions of specialized ribosomes are largely unknown, changes in the rRNA modification pattern have been observed in response to environmental changes, during development, and in disease. This suggests that rRNA modifications may contribute to the translational control of gene expression.},

Methyl labeling of RNA was achieved with L-[methyl-(3)H]methionine under conditions that suppress radioactive incorporation into the purine ring. RNA that contains a poly(A) segment was obtained from polysomal RNA by chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of this RNA revealed a pattern expected for mRNA. The composition of the methyl-labeled nucleosides in the RNA was analyzed after complete enzymatic degradation to nucleosides. By use of DEAE-cellulose (borate) chromatography, which separates 2'-O-methylnucleosides from normal and base-methylated nucleosides, about 50% of the radioactivity was recovered in the 2'-O-methylnucleoside fraction and 50% in the base-methylnucleoside fraction. High-speed liquid chromatography (Aminex A-5) of the 2'-O-methylnucleoside fraction produced four peaks coincident with the four 2'-O-methylnucleoside standards. Analysis of the base-methylnucleoside fraction revealed a unique pattern. While ribosomal RNA and tRNA possessed complex base-methylnucleoside patterns, the distribution in mRNA was quite simple, consisting predominantly of N(6)-methyladenosine. These results demonstrate a unique distribution of methylated nucleosides in mRNA. By analogy to ribosomal RNA synthesis, the presence of methylnucleosides in mRNA may reflect a cellular mechanism for the selective processing of certain mRNA sequences.},

The degree of methylation of this RNA was 1.8 methyl groups per 1000 nucleotides, or 4-5 methyl groups on the average per molecule. The nature of the methylated residues was determined by paper chromatography and electrophoresis of acid and alkaline hydrolysates, by DEAE cellulose chromatography of alkaline hydrolysates and of T2 RNase digests, and by examining the effect of subjecting samples to "beta-elimination." Approx. half of the methyl groups occurred in standard ("internal") linkage, 10% as m5Cp and 40% as m6Ap residues.

  abstract        = {Cytosine methylation within RNA is common, but its full scope and functions are poorly understood, as the RNA targets of most mammalian cytosine RNA methyltransferases (m(5)C-RMTs) remain uncharacterized. To enable their characterization, we developed a mechanism-based method for transcriptome-wide m(5)C-RMT target profiling. All characterized mammalian m(5)C-RMTs form a reversible covalent intermediate with their cytosine substrate-a covalent linkage that is trapped when conducted on the cytosine analog 5-azacytidine (5-aza-C). We used this property to develop Aza-immunoprecipitation (Aza-IP), a methodology to form stable m(5)C-RMT-RNA linkages in cell culture, followed by IP and high-throughput sequencing, to identify direct RNA substrates of m(5)C-RMTs. Remarkably, a cytosine-to-guanine (C→G) transversion occurs specifically at target cytosines, allowing the simultaneous identification of the precise target cytosine within each RNA. Thus, Aza-IP reports only direct RNA substrates and the C→G transversion provides an important criterion for target cytosine identification, which is not available in alternative approaches. Here we present a step-by-step protocol for Aza-IP and downstream analysis, designed to reveal identification of substrate RNAs and precise cytosine targets of m(5)C-RMTs. The entire protocol takes 40-50 d to complete.},

Here, we describe miCLIP as an additional approach for identifying RNA methylation sites in transcriptomes. miCLIP is a customized version of the individual-nucleotide-resolution crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) method. We confirm site-specific methylation in tRNAs and additional messenger and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Among these, vault ncRNAs contained six NSun2-methylated cytosines, three of which were confirmed by RNA bisulfite sequencing. Using patient cells lacking the NSun2 protein, we further show that loss of cytosine-5 methylation in vault RNAs causes aberrant processing into Argonaute-associated small RNA fragments that can function as microRNAs. Thus, impaired processing of vault ncRNA may contribute to the etiology of NSun2-deficiency human disorders.},

Moreover, m C formation in mRNAs is mainly catalyzed by the RNA methyltransferase NSUN2, and m C is specifically recognized by the mRNA export adaptor ALYREF as shown by in vitro and in vivo studies. NSUN2 modulates ALYREF's nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, RNA-binding affinity and associated mRNA export. Dysregulation of ALYREF-mediated mRNA export upon NSUN2 depletion could be restored by reconstitution of wild-type but not methyltransferase-defective NSUN2. Our study provides comprehensive m C profiles of mammalian transcriptomes and suggests an essential role for m C modification in mRNA export and post-transcriptional regulation.},

However, the distribution and biological functions of m C in plant mRNAs remain largely unknown. Here, we report transcriptome-wide profiling of RNA m C in Arabidopsis thaliana by applying m C RNA immunoprecipitation followed by a deep-sequencing approach (m C-RIP-seq). LC-MS/MS and dot blot analyses reveal a dynamic pattern of m C mRNA modification in various tissues and at different developmental stages. m C-RIP-seq analysis identified 6045 m C peaks in 4465 expressed genes in young seedlings. We found that m C is enriched in coding sequences with two peaks located immediately after start codons and before stop codons, and is associated with mRNAs with low translation activity. We further demonstrated that an RNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase, tRNA-specific methyltransferase 4B (TRM4B), exhibits m C RNA methyltransferase activity. Mutations in TRM4B display defects in root development and decreased m C peaks. TRM4B affects the transcript levels of the genes involved in root development, which is positively correlated with their mRNA stability and m C levels. Our results suggest that m C in mRNA is a new epitranscriptome marker inArabidopsis, and that regulation of this modification is an integral part of gene regulatory networks underlying plant development.},

Herein, through genome-wide profiling of RNA 5-methylcytosine (m C) modification in zebrafish early embryos, we found that m C-modified maternal mRNAs display higher stability than non-m C-modified mRNAs during MZT. We discovered that Y-box binding protein 1 (Ybx1) preferentially recognizes m C-modified mRNAs through π-π interactions with a key residue, Trp45, in Ybx1's cold shock domain (CSD), which plays essential roles in maternal mRNA stability and early embryogenesis of zebrafish. Together with the mRNA stabilizer Pabpc1a, Ybx1 promotes the stability of its target mRNAs in an m C-dependent manner. Our study demonstrates an unexpected mechanism of RNA m C-regulated maternal mRNA stabilization during zebrafish MZT, highlighting the critical role of m C mRNA modification in early development.},

Here, we present a method for transcriptome-wide m(6)A localization, which combines m(6)A-specific methylated RNA immunoprecipitation with next-generation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq). We use this method to identify mRNAs of 7,676 mammalian genes that contain m(6)A, indicating that m(6)A is a common base modification of mRNA. The m(6)A modification exhibits tissue-specific regulation and is markedly increased throughout brain development. We find that m(6)A sites are enriched near stop codons and in 3' UTRs, and we uncover an association between m(6)A residues and microRNA-binding sites within 3' UTRs. These findings provide a resource for identifying transcripts that are substrates for adenosine methylation and reveal insights into the epigenetic regulation of the mammalian transcriptome.},

M6A is installed by m6A methyltransferases, removed by m6A demethylases and recognized by reader proteins, which regulate of RNA metabolism including translation, splicing, export, degradation and microRNA processing. Alteration of m6A levels participates in cancer pathogenesis and development via regulating expression of tumor-related genes like BRD4, MYC, SOCS2 and EGFR.

  abstract        = {Investigations over the past eight years of chemical modifications on messenger RNA (mRNA) have revealed a new level of posttranscriptional gene regulation in eukaryotes. Rapid progress in our understanding of these modifications, particularly, N -methyladenosine (m A), has revealed their roles throughout the life cycle of an mRNA transcript. m A methylation provides a rapid mechanism for coordinated transcriptome processing and turnover that is important in embryonic development and cell differentiation. In response to cellular signals, m A can also regulate the translation of specific pools of transcripts. These mechanisms can be hijacked in human diseases, including numerous cancers and viral infection. Beyond m A, many other mRNA modifications have been mapped in the transcriptome, but much less is known about their biological functions. As methods continue to be developed, we will be able to study these modifications both more broadly and in greater depth, which will likely reveal a wealth of new RNA biology.},

These maps have revealed the specific mRNAs that are regulated by m A, providing mechanistic links connecting m A to cellular differentiation, cancer progression and other processes. The effects of m A on mRNA are mediated by an expanding list of m A readers and m A writer-complex components, as well as potential erasers that currently have unclear relevance to m A prevalence in the transcriptome.

The m⁶A modification in RNA can be catalyzed by methyltransferases, or removed by demethylases, which are termed m⁶A writers and erasers, respectively. Selective recognition and binding by distinct m⁶A reader proteins lead mRNA to divergent destinies. m⁶A has been reported to influence almost every stage of mRNA metabolism and to regulate multiple biological processes. Accumulating evidence strongly supports the correlation between aberrant cellular m⁶A level and cancer. We summarize here that deregulation of m⁶A modification, resulting from aberrant expression or function of m⁶A writers, erasers, readers or some other protein factors, is associated with carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Understanding the regulation and functional mechanism of mRNA m⁶A modification in cancer development may help in developing novel and efficient strategies for the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of human cancers.},

The RNA m A modification is also mediated by another group of proteins capable of recognizing m A that act as m A readers. The m A modification exerts direct control over the RNA metabolism including mRNA processing, mRNA exporting, translation initiation, mRNA stability and the biogenesis of long-non-coding RNA (LncRNA), thereby can influence various aspects of cell function. Evidently, m A is intimately associated with cancer development and progression such as self-renewal capacity of cancer stem cells, proliferation, apoptosis and therapeutic resistance, and immune response. In this review, we will discuss the regulation and function of m A, the various functions ascribed to these proteins and the emerging concepts that impact our knowledge of these proteins and their roles in the epitranscriptome.

Here we developed m6A individual-nucleotide-resolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (miCLIP) and used it to demonstrate that antibodies to m6A can induce specific mutational signatures at m6A residues after ultraviolet light-induced antibody-RNA cross-linking and reverse transcription. We found that these antibodies similarly induced mutational signatures at N(6),2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), a modification found at the first nucleotide of certain mRNAs. Using these signatures, we mapped m6A and m6Am at single-nucleotide resolution in human and mouse mRNA and identified small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) as a new class of m6A-containing non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs).},

One of the most prevalent modified bases is found at the 5' end of mRNA, at the first encoded nucleotide adjacent to the 7-methylguanosine cap. Here we show that this nucleotide, N ,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m A ), is a reversible modification that influences cellular mRNA fate. Using a transcriptome-wide map of m A  we find that m A -initiated transcripts are markedly more stable than mRNAs that begin with other nucleotides. We show that the enhanced stability of m A -initiated transcripts is due to resistance to the mRNA-decapping enzyme DCP2. Moreover, we find that m A  is selectively demethylated by fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO). FTO preferentially demethylates m A  rather than N -methyladenosine (m A), and reduces the stability of m A  mRNAs. Together, these findings show that the methylation status of m A  in the 5' cap is a dynamic and reversible epitranscriptomic modification that determines mRNA stability.},

Two-thirds of last exon m(6)A and >40% of all m(6)A in mRNA are present in 3' untranslated regions (UTRs); contrary to earlier suggestions, there is no preference for location of m(6)A sites around stop codons. Moreover, m(6)A is significantly higher in noncoding last exons than in next-to-last exons harboring stop codons. We found that m(6)A density peaks early in the 3' UTR and that, among transcripts with alternative polyA (APA) usage in both the brain and the liver, brain transcripts preferentially use distal polyA sites, as reported, and also show higher proximal m(6)A density in the last exons. Furthermore, when we reduced m6A methylation by knocking down components of the methylase complex and then examined 661 transcripts with proximal m6A peaks in last exons, we identified a set of 111 transcripts with altered (approximately two-thirds increased proximal) APA use. Taken together, these observations suggest a role of m(6)A modification in regulating proximal alternative polyA choice.},

Mettl3 knockout preimplantation epiblasts and naïve embryonic stem cells are depleted for m(6)A in mRNAs, yet are viable. However, they fail to adequately terminate their naïve state and, subsequently, undergo aberrant and restricted lineage priming at the postimplantation stage, which leads to early embryonic lethality. m(6)A predominantly and directly reduces mRNA stability, including that of key naïve pluripotency-promoting transcripts. This study highlights a critical role for an mRNA epigenetic modification in vivo and identifies regulatory modules that functionally influence naïve and primed pluripotency in an opposing manner.},

Importantly, we established a robust computational pipeline to tackle the inherent issue of false positives in antibody-based m6A detection. The analyses were calibrated with Mettl3 knockout cells to learn the characteristics of m6A deposition, including m6A sites outside of DRACH motifs. To make our results universally applicable, we trained a machine learning model, m6Aboost, based on the experimental and RNA sequence features. Importantly, m6Aboost allows prediction of genuine m6A sites in miCLIP2 data without filtering for DRACH motifs or the need for Mettl3 depletion. Using m6Aboost, we identify thousands of high-confidence m6A sites in different murine and human cell lines, which provide a rich resource for future analysis. Collectively, our combined experimental and computational methodology greatly improves m6A identification.},

MAZTER-seq permits validation and de novo discovery of m A sites, calibration of the performance of antibody-based approaches, and quantitative tracking of m A dynamics in yeast gametogenesis and mammalian differentiation. We discover that m6A stoichiometry is "hard coded" in cis via a simple and predictable code, accounting for 33%-46% of the variability in methylation levels and allowing accurate prediction of m A loss and acquisition events across evolution. MAZTER-seq allows quantitative investigation of m A regulation in subcellular fractions, diverse cell types, and disease states.},

We describe a detailed protocol to perform m A-REF-seq, including NGS library construction and sequencing data analysis. In particular, we describe an optimized assay to validate individual m A sites identified by m A-REF-seq, which can also be applied to detect any candidate m A sites.},

However, these methods have several limitations, including high input RNA requirements and cross-reactivity to other RNA modifications. Here, we present DART-seq (deamination adjacent to RNA modification targets), an antibody-free method for detecting m A sites. In DART-seq, the cytidine deaminase APOBEC1 is fused to the m A-binding YTH domain. APOBEC1-YTH expression in cells induces C-to-U deamination at sites adjacent to m A residues, which are detected using standard RNA-seq. DART-seq identifies thousands of m A sites in cells from as little as 10 ng of total RNA and can detect m A accumulation in cells over time. Additionally, we use long-read DART-seq to gain insights into m A distribution along the length of individual transcripts.},

Although the two antibody-free methods (m A-REF-seq/MAZTER-seq and DART-seq) have been developed recently, they are dependent on m A sequence or cellular transfection. Here, we present an antibody-free, FTO-assisted chemical labeling method termed m A-SEAL for specific m A detection. We applied m A-SEAL to profile m A landscapes in humans and plants, which displayed the known m A distribution features in transcriptome. By doing a comparison with all available m A sequencing methods and specific m A sites validation by SELECT, we demonstrated that m A-SEAL has good sensitivity, specificity and reliability for transcriptome-wide detection of m A. Given its tagging ability and FTO's oxidation property, m A-SEAL enables many applications such as enrichment, imaging and sequencing to drive future functional studies of m A and other modifications.},

Moreover, we unexpectedly discovered that ADAR proteins bind dsRNA substrates tandemly in vivo, each with a 50-bp footprint. Using RNA duplexes recognized by ADARs as readout of pre-messenger RNA structures, we reveal distinct higher-order architectures between pre-messenger RNAs and mRNAs.

We evaluate our method on transcriptome-wide m A profiling data, demonstrating that xPore identifies positions of m A sites at single-base resolution, estimates the fraction of modified RNA species in the cell and quantifies the differential modification rate across conditions. We apply xPore to direct RNA-seq data from six cell lines and multiple myeloma patient samples without a matched control sample and find that many m A sites are preserved across cell types, whereas a subset exhibit significant differences in their modification rates.

Pseudouridine, the most abundant modified nucleoside in non-coding RNAs, enhances the function of transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA by stabilizing the RNA structure. Messenger RNAs were not known to contain pseudouridine, but artificial pseudouridylation dramatically affects mRNA function--it changes the genetic code by facilitating non-canonical base pairing in the ribosome decoding centre. However, without evidence of naturally occurring mRNA pseudouridylation, its physiological relevance was unclear. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of pseudouridylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human RNAs using Pseudo-seq, a genome-wide, single-nucleotide-resolution method for pseudouridine identification. Pseudo-seq accurately identifies known modification sites as well as many novel sites in non-coding RNAs, and reveals hundreds of pseudouridylated sites in mRNAs. Genetic analysis allowed us to assign most of the new modification sites to one of seven conserved pseudouridine synthases, Pus1-4, 6, 7 and 9. Notably, the majority of pseudouridines in mRNA are regulated in response to environmental signals, such as nutrient deprivation in yeast and serum starvation in human cells. These results suggest a mechanism for the rapid and regulated rewiring of the genetic code through inducible mRNA modifications. Our findings reveal unanticipated roles for pseudouridylation and provide a resource for identifying the targets of pseudouridine synthases implicated in human disease.},

Here, we investigate when in their life cycle mRNAs become pseudouridylated to illuminate the potential regulatory functions of endogenous mRNA pseudouridylation. Using single-nucleotide resolution pseudouridine profiling on chromatin-associated RNA from human cells, we identified pseudouridines in nascent pre-mRNA at locations associated with alternatively spliced regions, enriched near splice sites, and overlapping hundreds of binding sites for RNA-binding proteins. In vitro splicing assays establish a direct effect of individual endogenous pre-mRNA pseudouridines on splicing efficiency. We validate hundreds of pre-mRNA sites as direct targets of distinct pseudouridine synthases and show that PUS1, PUS7, and RPUSD4-three pre-mRNA-modifying pseudouridine synthases with tissue-specific expression-control widespread changes in alternative pre-mRNA splicing and 3' end processing. Our results establish a vast potential for cotranscriptional pre-mRNA pseudouridylation to regulate human gene expression via alternative pre-mRNA processing.},

Perturbing pseudouridine synthases (PUS) uncovers which pseudouridine synthase modifies each site and their target sequence features. mRNA pseudouridinylation depends on both site-specific and snoRNA-guided pseudouridine synthases. Upon heat shock in yeast, Pus7p-mediated pseudouridylation is induced at >200 sites, and PUS7 deletion decreases the levels of otherwise pseudouridylated mRNA, suggesting a role in enhancing transcript stability. rRNA pseudouridine stoichiometries are conserved but reduced in cells from dyskeratosis congenita patients, where the PUS DKC1 is mutated.

Here we report on a new mRNA modification, N(1)-methyladenosine (m(1)A), that occurs on thousands of different gene transcripts in eukaryotic cells, from yeast to mammals, at an estimated average transcript stoichiometry of 20% in humans. Employing newly developed sequencing approaches, we show that m(1)A is enriched around the start codon upstream of the first splice site: it preferentially decorates more structured regions around canonical and alternative translation initiation sites, is dynamic in response to physiological conditions, and correlates positively with protein production. These unique features are highly conserved in mouse and human cells, strongly indicating a functional role for m(1)A in promoting translation of methylated mRNA.},

  abstract        = {Naturally occurring modified residues derived from canonical RNA nucleotides are present in most cellular RNAs. Their detection in RNA represents a difficult task because of their great diversity and their irregular distribution within RNA molecules. Over the decades, multiple experimental techniques were developed for the identification and localization of RNA modifications. Most of them are quite laborious and require purification of individual RNA to a homogeneous state. An alternative to these techniques is the use of reverse transcription (RT)-based approaches. In these approaches, purification of RNA to homogeneity is not necessary, because the selection of the analyzed RNA species is done by specific annealing of oligonucleotide DNA primers. However, results from primer extension analysis are difficult to interpret because of the unpredictable nature of RT pauses. They depend not only on the properties of nucleotides but also on the RNA primary and secondary structure. In addition, the degradation of cellular RNA during extraction, even at a very low level, may complicate the analysis of the data. RT-based techniques for the identification of modified residues were considerably improved by the development of selected chemical reagents specifically reacting with a given modified nucleotide. The RT profile obtained after such chemical modifications generally allows unambiguous identification of the chemical nature of the modified residues and their exact location in the RNA sequence. Here, we provide experimental protocols for selective chemical modification and identification of several modified residues: pseudouridine, inosine, 5-methylcytosine, 2'-O-methylations, 7-methylguanosine, and dihydrouridine. Advice for an optimized use of these methods and for correct interpretation of the data is also given. We also provide some helpful information on the ability of other naturally occurring modified nucleotides to generate RT pauses.},

Here we simultaneously analyze both parameters in detail with respect to the occurrence of N-1-methyladenosine (m(1)A) in the template RNA. This naturally occurring modification is associated with structural effects, but it is also known as a mediator of antibiotic resistance in ribosomal RNA. In structural probing experiments with dimethylsulfate, m(1)A is routinely detected by RT-arrest. A specifically developed RNA-Seq protocol was tailored to the simultaneous analysis of RT-arrest and misincorporation patterns. By application to a variety of native and synthetic RNA preparations, we found a characteristic signature of m(1)A, which, in addition to an arrest rate, features misincorporation as a significant component. Detailed analysis suggests that the signature depends on RNA structure and on the nature of the nucleotide 3' of m(1)A in the template RNA, meaning it is sequence dependent. The RT-signature of m(1)A was used for inspection and confirmation of suspected modification sites and resulted in the identification of hitherto unknown m(1)A residues in trypanosomal tRNA.},

With increasing labeling time the relative proportion of hnRNA molecules with tri- and diphosphorylated 5' ends decreases and the relative proportion of capped hnRNA increases, indicating that caps are metabolically more stable than the polyphosphate termini. About half of the hnRNA molecules that are labeled within 2 hr have capped ends. This finding, together with results of earlier kinetic and structural studies, implies that a relatively high proportion of the labeled hnRNA molecules are mRNA precursors. Large hnRNA molecules exhibit a higher proportion of capped ends and a lower proportion of 5'-triphosphate ends as compared to small hnRNA. Given the lower stability of triphosphate termini relative to caps, this result may mean that capping of some hnRNA molecules can occur before the completion of transcription.},

RNAs bearing 2'-O-methylations show increased resistance to degradation and enhanced stability in helices. While the exact role of each 2'-O-Me residue remained elusive, the catalytic protein Fibrillarin (Nop1 in yeast) responsible for 2'-O-methylation in eukaryotes, is associated with human pathologies. Therefore, there is an urgent need to precisely map and quantify hundreds of 2'-O-Me residues in RNA using high-throughput technologies. Here, we develop a reliable protocol using alkaline fragmentation of total RNA coupled to a commonly used ligation approach, and Illumina sequencing. We describe a methodology to detect 2'-O-methylations with high sensitivity and reproducibility even with limited amount of starting material (1 ng of total RNA). The method provides a quantification of the 2'-O-methylation occupancy of a given site, allowing to detect relatively small changes (>10%) in 2'-O-methylation profiles.

Noxious agents such as reactive oxygen species or alkylating chemicals have the potential to profoundly affect the chemical properties and hence the function of RNA molecules in the cell. Given the central role of RNA in many fundamental biological processes, including translation and splicing, changes to its chemical composition can have a detrimental impact on cellular fitness, with some evidence suggesting that RNA damage has roles in diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders. We are only just beginning to learn about how cells cope with RNA damage, with recent studies revealing the existence of quality-control processes that are capable of recognizing and degrading or repairing damaged RNA. Here, we begin by reviewing the most abundant types of chemical damage to RNA, including oxidation and alkylation. Focusing on mRNA damage, we then discuss how alterations to this species of RNA affect its function and how cells respond to these challenges to maintain proteostasis. Finally, we briefly discuss how chemical damage to noncoding RNAs such as rRNA, tRNA, small nuclear RNA, and small nucleolar RNA is likely to affect their function.},

  abstract        = {Unlike DNA, oxidative damage to RNA has received little attention presumably due to the assumed transient nature of RNA. However, RNAs including mRNA can persist for several hours to days in certain tissues and are demonstrated to sustain greater oxidative damage than DNA. Because neuronal cells in the brain are continuously exposed to reactive oxygen species due to a high oxygen consumption rate, it is not surprising that neuronal RNA oxidation is observed as a common feature at an early stage in a series of neurodegenerative disorders. A recent study on a well-defined bacterial translation system has revealed that mRNA containing 8-oxo-guanosine (8-oxoGuo) has little effect on fidelity despite the anticipated miscoding. Indeed, 8-oxoGuo-containing mRNA leads to ribosomal stalling with a reduced rate of peptide-bond formation by 3-4 orders of magnitude and is subject to no-go decay, a ribosome-based mRNA surveillance mechanism. Another study demonstrates that transfer RNA oxidation catalyzed by cytochrome   (cyt  ) leads to its depurination and cross-linking, which may facilitate cyt   release from mitochondria and subsequently induce apoptosis. Even more importantly, a discovery of oxidized microRNA has been recently reported. The oxidized microRNA causes misrecognizing the target mRNAs and subsequent down-regulation in the protein synthesis. It is noteworthy that oxidative modification to RNA not only interferes with the translational machinery but also with regulatory mechanisms of noncoding RNAs that contribute toward the biological complexity of the mammalian brain. Oxidative RNA damage might be a promising therapeutic target potentially useful for an early intervention of diverse neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  abstract        = {The past decade has provided exciting insights into a novel class of central (small) RNA molecules intimately involved in gene regulation. Only a small percentage of our DNA is translated into proteins by mRNA, yet 80% or more of the DNA is transcribed into RNA, and this RNA has been found to encompass various classes of novel regulatory RNAs, including, e.g., microRNAs. It is well known that DNA is constantly oxidized and repaired by complex genome maintenance mechanisms. Analogously, RNA also undergoes significant oxidation, and there are now convincing data suggesting that oxidation, and the consequent loss of integrity of RNA, is a mechanism for disease development. Oxidized RNA is found in a large variety of diseases, and interest has been especially devoted to degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer disease, in which up to 50-70% of specific mRNA molecules are reported oxidized, whereas other RNA molecules show virtually no oxidation. The iron-storage disease hemochromatosis exhibits the most prominent general increase in RNA oxidation ever observed. Oxidation of RNA primarily leads to strand breaks and to oxidative base modifications. Oxidized mRNA is recognized by the ribosomes, but the oxidation results in ribosomal stalling and dysfunction, followed by decreased levels of functional protein as well as the production of truncated proteins that do not undergo proper folding and may result in protein aggregation within the cell. Ribosomal dysfunction may also signal apoptosis by p53-independent pathways. There are very few reports on interventions that reduce RNA oxidation, one interesting observation being a reduction in RNA oxidation by ingestion of raw olive oil. High urinary excretion of 8-oxo-guanosine, a biomarker for RNA oxidation, is highly predictive of death in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetics; this demonstrates the clinical relevance of RNA oxidation. Taken collectively the available data suggest that RNA oxidation is a contributing factor in several diseases such as diabetes, hemochromatosis, heart failure, and β-cell destruction. The mechanism involves free iron and hydrogen peroxide from mitochondrial dysfunction that together lead to RNA oxidation that in turn gives rise to truncated proteins that may cause aggregation. Thus RNA oxidation may well be an important novel contributing mechanism for several diseases.},

However, actinomycin D, at a dosage of 250 mug/mouse in vivo and 10 mug/ml in vitro produces breakdown of labeled RNA, thus confirming earlier observations that the drug is not a suitable tool for RNA kinetics determinations.

Nucleic acid isolation is based on in vivo or in vitro incorporation of BrU or BrdU to either RNA or DNA, respectively, followed by immunoprecipitation of the labeled nucleic acid utilizing anti-BrdU MoAb, which crossreacts with BrU, attached to solid particles. Filter-bound bromine-labeled DNA or RNA was detected by immunoblotting with anti-BrdU MoAb, by a combined Southern/Western or Northern/Western approach, respectively. This method was applied to isolate and detect rRNA and mRNA from human cells, plasmid DNA from bacterial cells, and in vitro synthesized DNA. Newly transcribed BrU-labeled mRNA was recovered from the immunoprecipitates and analyzed by RT-PCR to study phorbol ester-mediated regulation of interleukin 1 gene transcription in human leukemic HL-60 or lymphoma U937 cells. The plasmid DNAs were isolated by immunoprecipitation from transformed bacterial cultures that were grown in the presence of BrdU and were detected immunochemically on filters. Likewise, the products of RT-PCR and Klenow polymerase-catalyzed DNA synthesis in which dTTP was replaced with BrdUTP were detected by immunoblotting. Since the method allows one to selectively separate or detect nucleic acids only synthesized during a pulse of the precursor, it can uniquely be used to identify nascent gene transcripts or the transcripts synthesized within specific time windows, e.g., after induction of differentiation, carcinogenesis, or drug treatment, and distinguish such transcripts from preexisting ones. In addition, this approach offers a simple and inexpensive alternative for preparing labeled DNA as well as RNA probes for use in a variety of hybridization protocols. Due to the low toxicity of BrU and BrdU, this approach can be used in analysis of gene transcription or DNA replication in vivo.},

  abstract        = {Mammalian genomes produce huge numbers of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). However, the functions of most ncRNAs are unclear, and novel techniques that can distinguish functional ncRNAs are needed. Studies of mRNAs have revealed that the half-life of each mRNA is closely related to its physiological function, raising the possibility that the RNA stability of an ncRNA reflects its function. In this study, we first determined the half-lives of 11,052 mRNAs and 1418 ncRNAs in HeLa Tet-off (TO) cells by developing a novel genome-wide method, which we named 5'-bromo-uridine immunoprecipitation chase-deep sequencing analysis (BRIC-seq). This method involved pulse-labeling endogenous RNAs with 5'-bromo-uridine and measuring the ongoing decrease in RNA levels over time using multifaceted deep sequencing. By analyzing the relationship between RNA half-lives and functional categories, we found that RNAs with a long half-life (t(1/2) ≥ 4 h) contained a significant proportion of ncRNAs, as well as mRNAs involved in housekeeping functions, whereas RNAs with a short half-life (t(1/2) < 4 h) included known regulatory ncRNAs and regulatory mRNAs. The stabilities of a significant set of short-lived ncRNAs are regulated by external stimuli, such as retinoic acid treatment. In particular, we identified and characterized several novel long ncRNAs involved in cell proliferation from the group of short-lived ncRNAs. We designated this novel class of ncRNAs with a short half-life as Short-Lived noncoding Transcripts (SLiTs). We propose that the strategy of monitoring RNA half-life will provide a powerful tool for investigating hitherto functionally uncharacterized regulatory RNAs.},

  abstract        = {Apoptosis is characterized by a complex and remarkably ordered choreography of events consisting of the preparatory and execution steps that all culminate in disposal of the cell remnants. The disposal occurs in a manner that is the least destructive to the tissue: the remains of nuclear chromatin and cytoplasm are packaged in apoptotic bodies which are then phagocytized by neighboring live cells without invoking inflammatory or autoimmune response. In the present study we describe that in the course of apoptosis cellular RNA becomes sequestered and packaged into granules and then into apoptotic bodies, separately from DNA. This separation, which appears to be initiated by the nucleolar segregation, was observed in HL-60 cells that were undergoing spontaneous apoptosis in cultures or were treated with the DNA-damaging drug, DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (CPT), or with the cell death ligand, tumor necrosis factor-alpha. RNA separation was also observed in apoptotic MCF-7 cells following treatment with CPT. RNA and DNA in apoptotic cells were identified histochemically, by their differential stainability with pyronin Y and Hoechst 33342 fluorochromes, respectively, and immunocytochemically, by labeling the RNA with BrU for various periods of time and detection of the incorporated precursor with fluoresceinated anti-BrU mAb; DNA was counterstained with 7-aminoactinomycin D. Over 90% of apoptotic bodies that contained RNA had no detectable DNA and vice versa, the apoptotic bodies containing DNA had no detectable RNA. Packaging RNA and DNA into separate apoptotic bodies suggests that the phagosomes of the cells that ingest these particles are specialized: some of them are responsible for DNA degradation, others for degradation of RNA. Such specialization may facilitate heterophagic degradation of nucleic acids during apoptosis.},

The combinatory analysis of both RNA synthesis and stability using Bru-Seq and BruChase-Seq allows for a much deeper understanding of mechanisms of gene regulation than afforded by the analysis of steady-state total RNA and should be useful in many biological settings.},

We present a method (global run-on sequencing, GRO-seq) that maps the position, amount, and orientation of transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerases genome-wide. In this method, nuclear run-on RNA molecules are subjected to large-scale parallel sequencing and mapped to the genome. We show that peaks of promoter-proximal polymerase reside on approximately 30% of human genes, transcription extends beyond pre-messenger RNA 3' cleavage, and antisense transcription is prevalent. Additionally, most promoters have an engaged polymerase upstream and in an orientation opposite to the annotated gene. This divergent polymerase is associated with active genes but does not elongate effectively beyond the promoter. These results imply that the interplay between polymerases and regulators over broad promoter regions dictates the orientation and efficiency of productive transcription.},

We demonstrate the use of this method in cultured cells, in which we examine the turnover of bulk RNA after EU pulses of varying lengths. We also use EU to assay transcription rates of various tissues in whole animals, both on sections and by whole-mount staining.

With the viability of click chemistry validated on synthetic RNA bearing "click"-reactive alkynes, the scope of the reaction is extended to in-vitro-transcribed or, indeed, any RNA, as a click-reactive azide is incorporated enzymatically. Once clickable groups are installed on RNA, they can be rapidly click labeled or conjugated together in click ligations, which may be either templated or nontemplated. In click ligations the resultant unnatural triazole-linked RNA backbone is not detrimental to RNA function, thus suggesting a broad applicability of click chemistry in RNA biological studies.},

The synthesis of RNA or DNA was assayed based on the biosynthetic incorporation of these analogues into newly transcribed RNA or replicating DNA. Analogue-labeled cellular RNA or DNA was detected quickly and with high sensitivity via "click" chemistry with fluorescent azides, followed by fluorescence microscopic imaging. The results showed that EC was efficiently incorporated into RNA, but not into DNA, in seven cell lines, as also previously shown for 5-ethynyluridine (EU). Moreover, EC was able to assay transcription rates of various tissues in animals and the rate of metabolism of EC was much faster than that of EU.},

We further demonstrate selectivity of our adenosine analogues for transcription and polyadenylation.

After short periods of treatment with 6-thioguanosine the proportion of RNA retained on mercurated cellulose is the same for both poly(A)-containing and poly(A)-free RNA, indicating similar incorporation of the drug into mRNA and rRNA. However, after longer periods of exposure, the cytotoxic effect of 6-thioguanosine results in diminished incorporation of radioactive uridine into RNA and of radioactive leucine into protein; this suggests that synthesis of both RNA and protein are impaired. On the other hand, even after long exposure to high concentrations of 4-thiouridine, the syntheses of RNA and protein are not significantly affected. Proteins synthesised after treatment of cells with 6-thioguanosine are less stable than proteins synthesised after treatment of cells with 4-thiouridine.},

We have developed a method to overcome this limitation by using the salvage enzyme uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) from the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii. T. gondii UPRT has been well characterized because of its application in monitoring parasite growth: mammals lack this enzyme activity and thus only the parasite incorporates (3)H-uracil into its nucleic acids. In this study we used RNA labeling by UPRT to determine the roles of mRNA synthesis and decay in the control of gene expression during T. gondii asexual development. We also used this approach to specifically label parasite RNA during a mouse infection and to incorporate thio-substituted uridines into the RNA of human cells engineered to express T. gondii UPRT, indicating that engineered UPRT expression will allow cell-specific analysis of gene expression in organisms other than T. gondii.},

A recent method for assessing mRNA dynamics is metabolic labeling with 4-thiouridine (4sU), followed by thio-selective attachment of affinity tags. Detection of labeled transcripts by affinity purification and hybridization to microarrays or by deep sequencing then reveals RNA expression levels. Here, we present a novel sequencing method (TUC-seq) that eliminates affinity purification and allows for direct assessment of 4sU-labeled RNA. It employs an OsO  -mediated transformation to convert 4sU into cytosine. We exemplify the utility of the new method for verification of endogenous 4sU in tRNAs and for the detection of pulse-labeled mRNA of seven selected genes in mammalian cells to determine the relative abundance of the new transcripts. The results prove TUC-seq as a straight-forward and highly versatile method for studies of cellular RNA dynamics.},

Here we combine metabolic labeling of RNA at high temporal resolution with advanced RNA quantification and computational modeling to estimate RNA transcription and degradation rates during the response of mouse dendritic cells to lipopolysaccharide. We find that changes in transcription rates determine the majority of temporal changes in RNA levels, but that changes in degradation rates are important for shaping sharp 'peaked' responses. We used sequencing of the newly transcribed RNA population to estimate temporally constant RNA processing and degradation rates genome wide. Degradation rates vary significantly between genes and contribute to the observed differences in the dynamic response. Certain transcripts, including those encoding cytokines and transcription factors, mature faster. Our study provides a quantitative approach to study the integrative process of RNA regulation.},

We identify 860 proteins that qualify as RBPs by biochemical and statistical criteria, adding more than 300 RBPs to those previously known and shedding light on RBPs in disease, RNA-binding enzymes of intermediary metabolism, RNA-binding kinases, and RNA-binding architectures.

  abstract        = {The RNA binding proteome (RBPome) was previously investigated using UV crosslinking and purification of poly(A)-associated proteins. However, most cellular transcripts are not polyadenylated. We therefore developed total RNA-associated protein purification (TRAPP) based on 254 nm UV crosslinking and purification of all RNA-protein complexes using silica beads. In a variant approach (PAR-TRAPP), RNAs were labelled with 4-thiouracil prior to 350 nm crosslinking. PAR-TRAPP in yeast identified hundreds of RNA binding proteins, strongly enriched for canonical RBPs. In comparison, TRAPP identified many more proteins not expected to bind RNA, and this correlated strongly with protein abundance. Comparing TRAPP in yeast and   showed apparent conservation of RNA binding by metabolic enzymes. Illustrating the value of total RBP purification, we discovered that the glycolytic enzyme enolase interacts with tRNAs. Exploiting PAR-TRAPP to determine the effects of brief exposure to weak acid stress revealed specific changes in late 60S ribosome biogenesis. Furthermore, we identified the precise sites of crosslinking for hundreds of RNA-peptide conjugates, using iTRAPP, providing insights into potential regulation. We conclude that TRAPP is a widely applicable tool for RBPome characterization.},

However, proteomic profiling of RBPs has been mostly limited to polyadenylated mRNA-binding proteins, leaving RBPs on nonpoly(A) RNAs, including most noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and pre-mRNAs, largely undiscovered. Here we present a click chemistry-assisted RNA interactome capture (CARIC) strategy, which enables unbiased identification of RBPs, independent of the polyadenylation state of RNAs. CARIC combines metabolic labeling of RNAs with an alkynyl uridine analog and in vivo RNA-protein photocross-linking, followed by click reaction with azide-biotin, affinity enrichment, and proteomic analysis. Applying CARIC, we identified 597 RBPs in HeLa cells, including 130 previously unknown RBPs. These newly discovered RBPs can likely bind ncRNAs, thus uncovering potential involvement of ncRNAs in processes previously unknown to be ncRNA-related, such as proteasome function and intermediary metabolism. The CARIC strategy should be broadly applicable across various organisms to complete the census of RBPs.},

We show that XRNAX captures all RNA biotypes and use this to characterize the sub-proteomes that interact with coding and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and to identify hundreds of protein-RNA interfaces. Exploiting the quantitative nature of XRNAX, we observe drastic remodeling of the RNA-bound proteome during arsenite-induced stress, distinct from autophagy-related changes in the total proteome. In addition, we combine XRNAX with crosslinking immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP-seq) to validate the interaction of ncRNA with lamin B1 and EXOSC2. Thus, XRNAX is a resourceful approach to study structural and compositional aspects of protein-RNA interactions to address fundamental questions in RNA-biology.},

We validated OOPS in HEK293, U2OS and MCF10A human cell lines, and show that 96% of proteins recovered were bound to RNA. We show that all long RNAs can be cross-linked to proteins, and recovered 1,838 RBPs, including 926 putative novel RBPs. OOPS is approximately 100-fold more efficient than existing methods and can enable analyses of dynamic RNA-protein interactions. We also characterize dynamic changes in RNA-protein interactions in mammalian cells following nocodazole arrest, and present a bacterial RNA-interactome for Escherichia coli.

Because 6sG is applicable to metabolic labeling of freshly synthesized RNA and because the conversion chemistry is fully compatible with the conversion of the frequently used metabolic label 4-thiouridine (4sU) into C, the combination of both modified nucleosides in dual-labeling setups enables high accuracy measurements of RNA decay. This approach, termed TUC-seq DUAL, uses the two modified nucleosides in subsequent pulses and their simultaneous detection, enabling mRNA-lifetime evaluation with unprecedented precision.},

Following a 1-h labeling period, enrichment for newly transcribed RNA after a single round of chromatography ranged between 10- and 15-fold when compared with total RNA. Exposure of CHO UrdA- cells, a uridine auxotrophic line, to 50 microM 4-TU allowed for optimal recovery of newly transcribed RNA. Increasing the concentration of 4-TU to 100 microM or labeling with 6-TG at concentrations of 3 microM or greater resulted in similar recoveries from uridine-prototrophic hamster cell lines. For shorter term labeling, exposure of prototrophic cells to 500 microM 4-TU or 100 microM 6-TG for 15 min allowed newly synthesized RNA to be selectively recovered. As a specific test case, enrichment for histone H3.2 mRNA was analyzed after hamster cells were labeled with 4-TU under conditions in which the gene was highly transcriptionally active. Northern blot analysis and the specific activity of thio-substituted RNA revealed a 15-fold enrichment when compared to total RNA. In vivo labeling of cellular RNA with 4-TU or 6-TG should provide a useful method for studying inducible gene expression and for isolating and cloning specific mRNAs from mammalian cells.},

Herein we report N -allyladenosine (a A) as a new small molecule for RNA labeling through both metabolic and enzyme-assisted manners. a A behaves like A and can be metabolically incorporated into newly synthesized RNAs inside mammalian cells. We also show that human RNA N -methyladenosine (m A) methyltransferases METTL3/METTL14 can work with a synthetic cofactor, namely allyl-SAM (S-adenosyl methionine with methyl replaced by allyl) in order to site-specifically install an allyl group to the N -position of A within specific sequence to generate a A-labeled RNAs. The iodination of N -allyl group of a A under mild buffer conditions spontaneously induces the formation of N ,N -cyclized adenosine and creates mutations at its opposite site during complementary DNA synthesis of reverse transcription. The existing m A in RNA is inert to methyltransferase-assisted allyl labeling, which offers a chance to differentiate m A from A at individual RNA sites. Our work demonstrates a new method for RNA labeling, which could find applications in developing sequencing methods for nascent RNAs and RNA modifications.},

Nano-ID combines metabolic RNA labeling, long-read nanopore sequencing of native RNA molecules, and machine learning. Nano-ID derives RNA stability estimates and evaluates stability determining factors such as RNA sequence, poly(A)-tail length, secondary structure, translation efficiency, and RNA-binding proteins. Application of nano-ID to the heat shock response in human cells reveals that many RNA isoforms change their stability. Nano-ID also shows that the metabolism of individual RNA isoforms differs strongly from that estimated for the combined RNA signal at a specific gene locus. Nano-ID enables studies of RNA metabolism at the level of single RNA molecules and isoforms in different cell states and conditions.},

  abstract        = {Global quantification of total RNA is used to investigate steady state levels of gene expression. However, being able to differentiate pre-existing RNA (that has been synthesized prior to a defined point in time) and newly transcribed RNA can provide invaluable information e.g. to estimate RNA half-lives or identify fast and complex regulatory processes. Recently, new techniques based on metabolic labeling and RNA-seq have emerged that allow to quantify new and old RNA: Nucleoside analogs are incorporated into newly transcribed RNA and are made detectable as point mutations in mapped reads. However, relatively infrequent incorporation events and significant sequencing error rates make the differentiation between old and new RNA a highly challenging task. We developed a statistical approach termed GRAND-SLAM that, for the first time, allows to estimate the proportion of old and new RNA in such an experiment. Uncertainty in the estimates is quantified in a Bayesian framework. Simulation experiments show our approach to be unbiased and highly accurate. Furthermore, we analyze how uncertainty in the proportion translates into uncertainty in estimating RNA half-lives and give guidelines for planning experiments. Finally, we demonstrate that our estimates of RNA half-lives compare favorably to other experimental approaches and that biological processes affecting RNA half-lives can be investigated with greater power than offered by any other method.
